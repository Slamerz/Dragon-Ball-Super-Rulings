### Unofficial FAQ:
#### 1
> Can I still activate this cards +2 marker skill if I am unable to add cards to my energy, or might not be able to add the top card of my deck to my energy due to a restriction like [{BT10-051 Goku Black, Future Decimator}](./BT10-051.md)'s [Activate Main]

Answer
> TLDR: Yes you can activate the skill, but you might not be able to complete the full effect of that skill.
>
> ~
> As long as you are able to pay the cost of a skill, you are able to activate it, even if you know the effect of the skill is impossible at the time.
> So in the case of a card like [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](#BT10-035-Zen-Oh-Cosmic-Unison) if you fulfill the cost of your leader card being mono blue and you increase it's markers by 2 the skill will activate and attempt to resolve.
> 
> The rules state that even if one action on a skill is impossible to carry out, you still continue and attempt to resolve as much of the skill as possible.

> The interaction with [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](#BT10-035-Zen-Oh-Cosmic-Unison) and [{BT10-051 Goku Black, Future Decimator}](./BT10-051.md) could go one of two ways.
>
> 1 (The top card of your deck is able to be added to your energy)
>
> - You have [{BT10-051 Goku Black, Future Decimator}](./BT10-051.md) in your hand and [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](#BT10-035-Zen-Oh-Cosmic-Unison) in play on your turn.
> - You Activate and resolve [{BT10-051 Goku Black, Future Decimator}](./BT10-051.md)'s [Activate main]
> - You Activate [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](#BT10-035-Zen-Oh-Cosmic-Unison)'s +2 marker ability
>  - The top card of your deck is a mono-blue 〈Zamasu〉 or 〈Goku Black〉 card
>  - You add the card to your energy
>  - You cannot add any more cards to your energy for the rest of the turn
>  - At the end of turn the mono-blue 〈Zamasu〉 or 〈Goku Black〉 card you added is sent to the drop.

>  - The top card of your deck is **NOT** a mono-blue 〈Zamasu〉 or 〈Goku Black〉 card
>  - You are unable to add the card to your energy, it is sent to the drop.

### [Official FAQ][1]: 
#### Q1
> You activate this card’s [+2] activate skill. If {BT1-044 Whis, The Resting Attendant}’s auto skill activates later that same turn, can you place the top card of your deck in your energy with it?

![Whis, The Resting Attendant](http://www.dbs-cardgame.com/images/cardlist/cardimg/BT1-044.png)

Answer
>  No, you can’t.
#### Q2
> At the end of a turn in which you activated this card’s [+2] skill, can you add the top 2 cards of your deck to your life with {EX08-04 SS Gogeta, All-Out Assault}’s auto skill?

![SS Gogeta, All-Out Assault](http://www.dbs-cardgame.com/images/cardlist/cardimg/EX08-04.png)

Answer
>  No, you can’t.
   {EX08-04 SS Gogeta, All-Out Assault}’s auto skill activates before the ”you can't place cards in your Energy Area for the turn” effect of this card’s [+2] skill ends, preventing you from adding the top 2 cards of your deck to your energy.
   End Phase processing occurs in the following order:
> 1. “End of turn” trigger conditions occur.
>
> 2. A checkpoint occurs. After resolving all necessary processes for this checkpoint, all effects that last “until the end of the turn” or “for the turn” end for the turn player.
