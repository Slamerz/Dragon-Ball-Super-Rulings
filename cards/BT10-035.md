  impossible act due to some reason,
  that act will not be carried out.

  the requested actions as possible


### [Official FAQ][1]: 
#### Q1
> You activate this card’s [+2] activate skill. If {BT1-044 Whis, The Resting Attendant}’s auto skill activates later that same turn, can you place the top card of your deck in your energy with it?

![Whis, The Resting Attendant](http://www.dbs-cardgame.com/images/cardlist/cardimg/BT1-044.png)

Answer
>  No, you can’t.
#### Q2
> At the end of a turn in which you activated this card’s [+2] skill, can you add the top 2 cards of your deck to your life with {EX08-04 SS Gogeta, All-Out Assault}’s auto skill?

![SS Gogeta, All-Out Assault](http://www.dbs-cardgame.com/images/cardlist/cardimg/EX08-04.png)

Answer
>  No, you can’t.
   {EX08-04 SS Gogeta, All-Out Assault}’s auto skill activates before the ”you can't place cards in your Energy Area for the turn” effect of this card’s [+2] skill ends, preventing you from adding the top 2 cards of your deck to your energy.
   End Phase processing occurs in the following order:
> 1. “End of turn” trigger conditions occur.
>
> 2. A checkpoint occurs. After resolving all necessary processes for this checkpoint, all effects that last “until the end of the turn” or “for the turn” end for the turn player.
