> After activating this cards [Activate main] am I able to activate card skills that add cards to my energy like [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](./BT10-35.md) even though I can't guarantee the card it tries to add will be a mono-blue ã€ˆZamasuã€‰ or ã€ˆGoku Blackã€‰ card.

Answer
> TLDR: Yes you can activate the skill, but you might not be able to complete the full effect of that skill.
>
> ~
> As long as you are able to pay the cost of a skill, you are able to activate it, even if you know the effect of the skill is impossible at the time.
> So in the case of a card like [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](./BT10-35.md) if you fulfill the cost of your leader card being mono blue and you increase it's markers by 2 the skill will activate and attempt to resolve.
> 
> The rules state that even if one action on a skill is impossible to carry out, you still continue and attempt to resolve as much of the skill as possible.
