Answer
> TLDR: Yes you can activate the skill, but you will not be able to add any cards to your energy.
>
> ~
> As long as you are able to pay the cost of a skill, you are able to activate it, even if you know the effect of the skill is impossible at the time.
> So in the case of a card like [{BT10-035 Zen-Oh, Cosmic Unison}](./BT10-035.md) if you fulfill the cost of your leader card being mono blue and you increase it's markers by 2 the skill will activate and attempt to resolve.
> 
> The rules state that even if one action on a skill is impossible to carry out, you still continue and attempt to resolve as much of the skill as possible.
