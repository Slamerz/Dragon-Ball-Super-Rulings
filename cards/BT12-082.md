> Can I choose [{BT12-082 The Tree of Might}](#bt12-082-the-tree-of-might) as the target for {[BT1-057 Broly, The Legendary Super Saiyan](./BT1-057.md)}'s Auto?

![Broly, The Legendary Super Saiyan](http://www.dbs-cardgame.com/images/cardlist/cardimg/BT1-057_b.png)

Answer:
> TLDR: Yes you can choose it, [{BT12-082 The Tree of Might}](#bt12-082-the-tree-of-might) will stay in the battle zone, and you will discard 1 card from your hand, but your opponent will still have to choose and send 1 card from their battle zone and hand to the drop.

>~
> 
> There is no effect on [{BT12-082 The Tree of Might}](#bt12-082-the-tree-of-might) that would prevent a card from choosing it as the target of a skill, and sending the chosen card to the drop is not a cost of {[BT1-057 Broly, The Legendary Super Saiyan](./BT1-057.md)}'s skill, but the effect of the skill.

> Dragon Ball Super requires that once an ability is activate that you complete as much of the ability as possible.
>
> This means that even if parts of the ability are impossible to complete, like sending [{BT12-082 The Tree of Might}](#bt12-082-the-tree-of-might) to the drop, you still do everything else that is possible in the skill. 
>
> So if your opponent can choose a card in their battle zone they would still have to send said card to the drop.
>
> This is also why if you are playing {[BT1-057 Broly, The Legendary Super Saiyan](./BT1-057.md)} and have {BT1-081 Broly's Ring} in the battle zone when you activate {[BT1-057 Broly, The Legendary Super Saiyan](./BT1-057.md)}'s Auto you don't have to discard a card, but your opponent still has to do so.
>
> That being said if you have both [{BT12-082 The Tree of Might}](#bt12-082-the-tree-of-might) and {BT1-081 Broly's Ring} in the battle zone, you could activate {[BT1-057 Broly, The Legendary Super Saiyan](./BT1-057.md)}'s auto without discarding a card from your hand, or sending a card in the battle zone to the drop, while your opponent still has to do both.
