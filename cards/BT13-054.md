> During combat on my opponents turn, I Activate [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](./BT13-060.md) paying all costs.

> If I only have 1 energy in active mode, do I have to put it in rest mode at the end of combat, do I have to put it into rest mode due to [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](./BT13-060.md), or can I activate [{BT13-054 Bujin, the Evildoer}](#BT13-054-boujack--the-evildoer)'s [Auto] paying it's cost with my 1 energy, then resolve [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](./BT13-060.md)?

Answer
> TLDR: You can resolve all pending effects in the order of your choice. You can resolve [{BT13-054 Bujin, the Evildoer}](#BT13-054-boujack--the-evildoer)'s auto first, then resolve [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](./BT13-060.md).

> According to the developers themselves, because [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](./BT13-060.md)'s skill is delayed, and has a trigger it is resolved during the next checkpoint like an [Auto] skill. They also rule that a delayed effect is not completed via rules processing, and thus you get to choose the order of skill resolutions, whether you're finishing an already activated skill with a delay like [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](./BT13-060.md) or if you want to activate and resolve a pending auto.
