Answer
> TLDR: You can resolve all pending effects in the order of your choice. You can resolve [{BT13-052 Bido, The Evildoer}](./BT13-052.md)'s auto first, then resolve [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](#BT13-060-Galactic-Buster-Ruling).

> According to the developers themselves, because [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](#BT13-060-Galactic-Buster-Ruling)'s skill is delayed, and has a trigger it is resolved during the next checkpoint like an [Auto] skill. They also rule that a delayed effect is not completed via rules processing, and thus you get to choose the order of skill resolutions, whether you're finishing an already activated skill with a delay like [{BT13-060 Galactic Buster Ruling}](#BT13-060-Galactic-Buster-Ruling) or if you want to activate and resolve a pending auto.
