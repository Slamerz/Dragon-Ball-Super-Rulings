  flipped to its front, it’s treated as the
  same card as when it was face down.

> Does this mean that negative effects on an opponent's leader like {BT10-116 Syn Shenron, Shadow Dragon Leader}'s on play auto are no longer removed by awaken?

Answer
> TLDR: No this addition to the rulebook changes no current rulings, and effects on leader cards still don't carry over.
> The rule clearly states "**any continuous effects affecting the card's power are carried over**" meaning the only effects that remain are those which change power.
>
> ~
>
> The wording on effects that are carried over states that only power changes are carried over, so additional effects like {BT10-116 Syn Shenron, Shadow Dragon Leader}'s on play auto or {BT1-005 Furthering Destruction Champa}'s auto do not carry over.
>
> This is also not a new rule, but has actually always been the wording in previous rulebooks for both the [Awaken] and [Wish] skills.
>
> This change to the rule book moves this wording into the rules processing section to simplify the wording of [Awaken] and [Wish] skills, but also clarifies that leader cards that are flipped by something other than [Awaken] or [Wish] also behave the same, such as {BT12-001 Launch | Launch, Nothing to Sneeze At}.
